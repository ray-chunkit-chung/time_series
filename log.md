**Theme 1: Time series clustering PRJ_TSC**. To make sense out of time series in unsupervised manners.

Based on https://blog.newrelic.com/2017/10/23/optimizing-k-means-clustering/, wrote a kmean clustering for fixed length time series. 

## Day 001: Jul 07, 2018

**PRJ_TSC**. Compared my code with sklearn kmeans. Sklearn out-performed in recognizing cluster and robust against cendroid collapse.

Added linear dummy data for testing.

## Day 003: Jul 08, 2018

**PRJ_TSC**. Parallel the kmean by ipyparallel based on https://blog.newrelic.com/2017/10/23/optimizing-k-means-clustering/

## Day 004: Jul 09, 2018

**PRJ_TSC**. Search for any existing dynamic time wrapping (dtw) implementation.

# 100 Days Of ML Code Backlog

**PRJ_TSC**. Make example data to benchmark a few existing dtw implementations.

**PRJ_TSC**. Variable length time series kmeans with dtw.

**PRJ_TSC**. Time series clustering wrap over the kmeans and dtw.

**PRJ_TSC**. Try a multi-variant Lower-bounded dtw here. http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/mm-40.pdf

**PRJ_TSC**. Try a GMM? Try an HMM? Try a VAE?

**Theme 2: Study stats and models STDY_MDL**. Properties and uses of priors, exp family, latent models, etc..

**Theme 3: Study search and combinational optimization STDY_SRCH**.

**Theme 4: Study python speed up STDY_SPDUP**. Cython, pypy, parallel computating, vectorize technique algorithm etc.

**Theme 5: Prepare production env PRJ_PROD** 

**Theme 6: Blog styling PRJ_BLOG**
