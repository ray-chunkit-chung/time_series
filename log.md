**Theme No.1: Time series clustering PRJ_TSC**. To make sense out of time series in unsupervised manners.

Based on https://blog.newrelic.com/2017/10/23/optimizing-k-means-clustering/, wrote a kmean clustering for fixed length time series. 

## Day 001: Jul 07, 2018

**PRJ_TSC**. Compared my code with sklearn kmeans. Sklearn out-performed in recognizing cluster and robust against cendroid collapse.

Added linear dummy data for testing.
